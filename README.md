To run this blog on you locale machine, you will need to install [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/"Jekyll"), kindly refer to the installation process on the official website of jekyll [here](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/"here").

Sometimes it can be hard to know if jekyll is installed, to check if it is successfully installed run this command

```bash
    jekyll -v
```

if successfully installed you will get

```
here the x.x.x is the version of jekyll, and if you get an error, it means that jekyll has failed to install. Kindly check [this](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/troubleshooting/#installation-problems"this").
