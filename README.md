# Machine Intelligence Blog (MIB)

Machine Intelligence Blog (MIB) is your companion blog to get you up and running with machine learning and data science. On this blog, I will cover topics in the machine learning field ranging from maths, programming, algorithm optimization with also data analysis.

## Getting Started

If you are interested in using or contribute to this blog, you will need some tools on your machine.

### Prerequisites

To run this blog on you locale machine, you will need to install [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/"Jekyll"), kindly refer to the installation process on the official website of jekyll [here](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/"here").

Sometimes it can be hard to know if jekyll is installed, to check if it is successfully installed run this command

```bash
    jekyll -v
```

if successfully installed you will get

```bash
    jekyll X.X.X
```
here the x.x.x is the version of jekyll, and if you get an error, it means that jekyll has failed to install. Kindly check [this](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/troubleshooting/#installation-problems"this").

### Run

After this, you will clone this repo(or download it) then using the command line, navigate to the root directory and input this for the first time

```bash
    bundle exec jekyll serve
```
to run jekyll after the first time, simply use

```bash
    jekyll serve
