# About the author

Hi there! welcome to Machine Intelligence Blog! I'm Stern Semasuka, and I'm a data engineer based in Calgary and currently working at [Westjet](https://www.westjet.com/en-ca). I'm interested in using machine learning to solve humankind challenges especially in the finance sector. The act of writing posts helps to explain complex topics in simple words using the [Feynman Technique](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f-qkGJBPts).

I firmly believe that ***anyone***, with enough commitment and perseverance (gonna need a lot of it 😉), can learn and understand machine learning and start using it right away to solve challenges.

# Why another machine learning blog?

This one is different. This blog helps anyone who is interested in Machine Learning but doesn't have a clue where to start because many blogs out there assume that you already a bad*ss data scientist. I said to myself why not create a resource to help anyone who might be on the same journey.

I write on topics ranging from programming, machine learning models and little bit of maths behind them, SQL, data analysis to model optimization used in machine learning through easy to understand projects. The post starts from the beginner level of machine learning to more advanced topic.
