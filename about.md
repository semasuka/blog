My name is Semasuka Stern, I am a passionate software engineer and an unapologetically geek. I been writing code for 3 years, since then I have graduated from university and from a coding bootcamp. Now, I am on a journey to become a machine intelligence (or machine learning) engineer.

# Why another coding blog?

I promise, this one is different. I am teaching myself machine learning starting from the beginner level to expert level and I will continually share important concepts that I will be learning through my posts at least once a week. these concepts will range from maths, programming to algorithm optimization.
