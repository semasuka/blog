    "  Since the objective of this problem is to minimize the risk of a credit default, the metrics to use depends on the current economic situation:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - During a bull market (when the economy is expanding), people feel wealthy and are employed. Money is usually cheap, and the risk of default is low because of economic stability and low unemployment. The financial institution can handle the risk of default; therefore, it is not very strict about giving credit. The financial institution can handle some bad clients as long as most credit card owners are good clients (aka those who pay back their credit in time and in total).In this case, having a good recall (sensitivity) is ideal.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - During a bear market (when the economy is contracting), people lose their jobs and money through the stock market and other investment venues. Many people struggle to meet their financial obligations. The financial institution, therefore, tends to be more conservative in giving out credit or loans. The financial institution can't afford to give out credit to many clients who won't be able to pay back their credit. The financial institution would rather have a smaller number of good clients, even if it means that some good clients are denied credit. In this case, having a good precision (specificity) is desirable.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ***Note***: There is always a trade-off between precision and recall. Choosing the right metrics depends on the problem you are solving.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ***Conclusion***: Since the time I worked on this project (beginning 2022), we were in the longest bull market (excluding March 2020 flash crash) ever recorded; we will use recall as our metric.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " **Lessons learned and recommendation**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Based on this project's analysis, income, family member headcount, and employment length are the three most predictive features in determining whether an applicant will be approved for a credit card. Other features like age and working employment status are also helpful. The least useful features are the type of dwelling and car ownership.\n",
    "- The recommendation would be to focus more on the most predictive features when looking at the applicant profile and pay less attention to the least predictive features."

    "- NumPy is a library for manipulating multidimensional arrays and matrices. In this project, we will use NumPy to change the sequences of the elements in a list and also transform an array with negative values into absolute ones.\n",

    "- MissingNo is a great library to visualize at a glance missing value in a Pandas dataframe.\n",
    "- Scipy is a library that contains mathematical modules like statistics, optimization, linear algebra, etc\n",
    "- Pathlib is a built-in python library with useful path functionalities. Pathlib will use it in the project to check if a file exists at a specific path, then use the joblib to save it.\n",
    "- Matplotlib is a data visualization library to plot different types of plots like histograms, line plots, scatter plots, contour plots, etc. It is built on top of NumPy.\n",
    "- Seaborn is another data visualization library built on top of Matplotlib with added features and simpler syntax than Matplotlib. We will mainly use this library for our exploratory data analysis.\n",
    "- Warnings is a python builtin library to control the warnings at the execution time\n",
    "- Scikit-learn, also called sklearn, is the industry standard machine learning library from which all the machine learning algorithms are imported. It is built on NumPy, Scipy, and Matplotlib.\n",
    "- Imbalance learn is a library based on sklearn, which provides tools when dealing with classification with imbalanced classes. Here classes mean the prediction results, which in this case, are approved or denied for a credit card. In this project, we have two outcomes (we have a binary classification), and one of the outcomes is less likely to happen, which is reflected in the data. So we use the SMOTE technique to balance the outcomes because we don't want to train on unbalanced data as we try to avoid bias.\n",
    "- Scikit-plot is a helpful library that plots scikit-learn objects; for this project, Scikit-plot will use to plot the ROC curve.\n",
    "- Yellowbrick extends the scikit-learn API library to make a model selection. In this project, we have used it to plot the feature importance.\n",
    "- Joblib is a builtin python library to save models as files; those models will deploy on AWS S3\n",
    "- os is a builtin library to access some of the operating system functionality\n",
    "- Finally, magic command ```%matplotlib inline``` will make your plot outputs appear and be stored within the notebook."

    "Now we perform a quick bivariate analysis of ```Age``` and the target variable ```Is high risk```. The blue box plot represents good client(is high risk = No) and the green box plot represents bad client(is high risk = Yes). We can see that there is no significant difference between the age of those who are high risk and those who are not. It seems like the median age for both groups is around 43 years old. This mean that there is no correlation between the age and the class in the target variable."

The financial institution is able to handle the risk of default therefore is not very strict on giving out credit. The financial institution can handle a number of bad clients as long as the vast majority of applicants are good clients (aka those who payback their credit).In this case, having a good recall (sensitivity) is ideal.\n",
    "- During a bear market (when the economy is contracting), people loose their jobs and their money through the stock market. Many people struggle to meet their financial obligations. The financial institution therefore tend to be more conservative on giving out credit or loans. The financial institution can't afford to give out credit to clients who won't be able to pay back their credit. The financial institution would rather have a smaller number of good clients even if it means that some good clients where denied credit, and ideally not have any bad client. In this case, having a good precision (specificity) is desirable.\n",
